# Memeconomy
A creative project completed along with a partner, shoutout to Zhi Shen Yong!

### Project Description
This web app idea is related to recent trends in content creation but also looks to the future by expanding the definition of licensed content. Our website maintains this general theme by delivering **memes** as if they are a truly legitimate 
form of licensed content (the legitimacy of memes as art/licensed content today is up for debate). 

Some websites that inspired us: DeviantArt, ebay

### Walkthrough

This website was built within the Cloud9 development environment, using the AMP stack (Apache, MySQL, PHP) and the Bootstrap v4.0 front-end HTML/CSS/JS framework. The majority of our files are PHP scripts, used to query MySQL tables that were set up in Cloud9, using the Terminal. Note that accessing MySQL on C9 is a bit different from accessing MySQL through your own computer's command line tool.
